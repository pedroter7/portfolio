            "My name is Pedro Tersetti Freidinger and I am passionated about learning, building, fixing and making stuff work. My interest for engineering aroused back when I was about 10 years old by reading books about computers and then, a few time later, building my first computer from scratch.",
            "It was during 2018, when I enrolled in the Bachelor of Science & Technology course at Federal Univerisity of ABC (Brazil), that I decided that solving problems and building things is what I want to do for a living. Since then I have been foccused on majoring Computer Science.",
            "My journey in Software Engineering began oficially in March 2022, when I had the opportunity to take part in an internship program at one of the biggest bureaus of credit in Brazil. Since then I have been actively taking part in software design, documentation, management, lifecycle and, of course, development activities. Unofficially, I have been in touch with the Software Engineering field since somewhere between 2020 and 2021, when I started taking more advanced courses in college such as distributed systems and algorithms. Before diving deep in Software Engineering, I also worked in the Cybersecurity field and took part in an internship in Systems Management for about 5 months.",
            "Beyond the Software Engineering world I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, data, moutain biking, travelling, reading and writing. As a matter of languages, my mother tongue is Portuguese but I also speak English, a little of Spanish and Hungarian."

Besides that, during my professional and college experiences I have developed and improved critical skills, such as software and systems documentation, project elaboration and presentation, communication, leadership and teamwork. Below there is a summary of the technologies I have been working with recently, other technologies I have some experience working with and I also leave a spoiler about technologies that I am planning on getting familiar with in the near future."

I like to highlight two challenges as the biggest ones during this migration projects: i) the challenge to keep the legacy system working side-by-side and collaboratively with the already migrated to microservices architecture parts of the system; ii) the challenge to learn the logic and business rules behind the legacy system, discuss and plan with the tech and business teams how to improve these rules in order to make the new small parts of the system better.",

Each small piece of the legacy system that was migrated brought us (the team) a huge ammount of data that we later, during agile meetings and learning journals, transformed into knowledge, specially when it comes to those two challenges that have been highlighted above."
